lvb_tentacle_extinction_cat: "A Lush Planet"
lvb_tentacle_extinction_cat_desc: "[Root.GetName] is exceptionally green, and preliminary scans indicate that there might be several things of interest on the surface."

lvb_tentacle_covered: "Tentacle Infested"
lvb_tentacle_covered_desc: "Extremely aggressive and horny creatures infest this planet, making it dangerous to set foot on the surface."

lvb_tentacle_extinction_dig: "Kidnapped Scientist"

tentacle_extinction_chain_title: "Tentacle Planet"
tentacle_extinction_chain_desc: "A planet covered with tentacle monsters. Ancient ruins indicating [Root.GetName] once bore thriving civilization. A kidnapped [Root.GetScientist]. We should attempt a rescue, and learn what's going on here at the same time."

lvb_tentacle_extinction.1.name: "Kidnapped by tentacle monsters"
lvb_tentacle_extinction.1.desc: "[lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName] was leading an expedition to survey the seemingly idyllic world when the expedition was attacked by the local wildlife, which turns out to be exceedingly strong and very horny. The shuttle cameras recorded the away team's capture and rape before the pilot had to take off lest she too be taken. [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName]'s transponder indicates that [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetSheHe] is still alive, but we'll need to learn more about the wildlife before mounting a rescue attempt."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.1.continue: "This is horrible!"

lvb_tentacle_extinction.10.name: "Safe(?) landing"
lvb_tentacle_extinction.10.desc: "The expedition finally made a breakthrough when one of the pilots running a low-altitude survey of the planet discovered that the monsters infesting every continent seemed to avoid certain species of trees. Isolating a pungent oil from the bark has allowed our scientists to land and begin learning more about this bizzare ecology. The oil only lasts a day - progress has been slowed by the fact that several explorers go missing every month when they're even a few minutes late reapplying the tentacle-repellent."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.10.continue: "Press on."

lvb_tentacle_extinction.11.name: "Under the jungle"
lvb_tentacle_extinction.11.desc: "Beneath the jungles of [From.Planet.GetName], we've found something interesting - this planet was once home to a technological civilization. The fact that they mainly built with concrete and steel suggests that they hadn't yet reached the stars when they went extinct. Preliminary analysis suggests that they had biology somewhat similar to [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and many speculate that this is why the tentacle monsters find us so fascinating while they completely ignore other native animals."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.11.continue: "What happened to them..."

lvb_tentacle_extinction.12.name: "Genetics gone wrong"
lvb_tentacle_extinction.12.desc: "The tentacle monsters are unable to procreate on their own. Our research team discovered this after security finaly managed to kill several of them as they broke into the fortified compound late at night, opening the door to genetic analysis. Though they seem able to use our species as mothers, left to their own devices they would go extinct within a generation. Given the ruins on the planet - dating back at least a thousand years - this raises horrifying possibilities."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.12.continue: "Press on!"

lvb_tentacle_extinction.13.name: "Tunnels"
lvb_tentacle_extinction.13.desc: "Though it's been some time since [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName] disappeared, [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetSheHe] have not been forgotten. Tracking [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetHerHim] transponder has led the investigation below ground, to a series of tunnels seemingly covering most of the planets surface. These tunnels were fiercely defended, and even the tree oil isn't enough to repel the monsters when our teams attempt to enter them. We'll have to fight our way in if we want to find [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName] and other lost team members."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.13.continue: "[lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName] still lives. Find [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetHerHim]."

lvb_tentacle_extinction.14.name: "Breeding Chambers"
lvb_tentacle_extinction.14.desc: "This excavation has taken on the tone of a military campaign more than an archaeological expedition. Fighting their way in, our troops finally managed to find their way to [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName]'s transponder, and what they found there horrified and arroused them. [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetSheHeCap] has been half absorbed by a living wall, along with thousands of other people, forced to constantly play host to the beasts' broods.\n\nThough our forces freed [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName], the experience has left [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetHerHim] somewhat more sex-crazed than the normal. The decision remains what to do with the rest of the monsters."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.14.continue: "At least [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName] is home again."

lvb_tentacle_extinction_burn_out: "Burn them out"
lvb_tentacle_extinction_burn_out_DESC: "Cleanse this abominable planet with fire. Kill every last one of the monsters and let us never speak of this again."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.20.desc: "Cleansing this abominable planet with guns and fire has had the desired effect, exterminating the tentacle monsters that once called it home. It hasn't wiped out all traces of their existence, however - the atmosphere remains filled with pheromones, and any future settlers will likely experience extremely high fertility. Let us never speak of the cause of said bonus again."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.20.continue: "Clean at last"

lvb_tentacle_extinction_recruit: "Use them as an army"
lvb_tentacle_extinction_recruit_DESC: "Though rather hornier than traditional for invading armies, the tentacle monsters are extremely hard to kill, and would make excellent shock troops if we could figure out how to tame them."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.21.desc: "Though rather hornier than traditional for invading armies, the tentacle monsters are extremely hard to kill, and make excellent shock troops now that we've mastered the ability to control them. Many in the scientific community suspect this is what they were originally designed for. Let any planet they're unleashed upon beware."

lvb_tentacle_extinction_use_them: "Use them as breeders"
lvb_tentacle_extinction_use_them_DESC: "Each subject in one of these flesh walls produces hundreds of tentacle monster offspring in their lives before their wombs wear out. There's no reason we couldn't force them to give birth to new citizens instead of monsters, once we tame these creatures."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.22.desc: "Each subject in one of these flesh walls produces hundreds of tentacle monster offspring before their wombs and minds wear out from the constant orgasmic bliss. There's no reason we couldn't force them to give birth to new citizens instead of monsters. We have more volunteers than expected, as well as a rapidly growing population."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.22.continue: "Their sacrifice is a worthy one."

lvb_tentacle_extinction_experiment: "Experiment on them"
lvb_tentacle_extinction_experiment_DESC: "Strong, fast and nearly indestructible, there is a great deal we could learn from these monsters. Let us tame them enough that we can settle this world, but not so thoroughly that we can no longer experiment on them."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.23.desc: "Strong, fast and nearly indestructible, there is a great deal we can learn from these monsters. We've rendered the planet safe for habitation, and our scientists are eager to begin."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.23.continue: "We'll waste no time."

lvb_tentacle_extinction_rescue: "Rescue victims"
lvb_tentacle_extinction_rescue_DESC: "The original species of [Root.GetName] is alive and well, kept capitive by the tentacle monsters for breeding purposes. Common decency requires that we attempt to help them."
lvb_tentacle_extinction.24.desc: "The original species of [Root.GetName] is alive and well, kept capitive by the tentacle monsters for breeding purposes. Thanks to the tireless efforts of our troops, they're now free, and slowly regaining their sanity. Though their infrastructure is in ruins, they've eagerly joined our empire for protection against the hostile universe. Only one difficulty remains - no males survived the centuries of imprisonment and rape, and selective breeding by their captors has left them good for little other than breeding and sex. The planet is likely to be a popular target for immigration by males the galaxy over in the coming years."

lvb_living_laboratory_cat_desc: "[Root.GetName] hosts a single set of overgrown ruins on its otherwise pristine surface, easily detectable from orbit. There's no sign of the inhabitants."

lvb_living_laboratory_dig: "Abandoned Outpost"

living_laboratory_chain_title: "Abandoned Planet"
living_laboratory_chain_desc: "[Root.GetName] hosts is uninhabited and undeveloped, save an abandoned outpost on the southern continent, nestled in a remote valley - it would be hard to locate from the surface, but is extremely obvious from orbit. There's no sign of the inhabitants, so some exploration seems in order."

lvb_living_laboratory.1.name: "Subsurface Complex"
lvb_living_laboratory.1.desc: "Our exploration team landed some distance away and approached the outpost on foot. Nothing barred their approach, and preliminary surveys confirmed that the area is indeed abandoned. The outpost appears to be a cluster of prefabricated buildings, showing considerable sophistication, and bearing signs of a methodical evacuation that leaving little of value - material or informational - behind. However, the buildings on the surface seem to be little more than the entrance to a much larger (and sealed) underground facility. Exploring beneath the surface will require an archaeological expedition."
lvb_living_laboratory.1.continue: "We'll send a team later."

lvb_living_laboratory.10.name: "Accidental Lockdown"
lvb_living_laboratory.10.desc: "The doors to the underground facility proved to very well armored, and our team eventually resorted to a liberal application of explosives and heavy-duty industrial equipment. Once inside, their ears were assaulted by a warning claxon, which proved remarkably easy to disable by acknowledging the prompt on the unsecured computer terminal right in front of their still smoking entry, It does not appear to have been an extremely secure facility so much as one that accidentally entered lockdown for unknown reasons.\n\nThe team is ready to begin their examination of the computers, and venture deeper inside."
lvb_living_laboratory.10.continue: "Proceed."

lvb_living_laboratory.11.name: "Dirty Science"
lvb_living_laboratory.11.desc: "Exploring the computer systems on [Root.GetName] has proven... interesting. They appear to contain research notes in an unknown alien language accompanying copious recordings of... well... sex. There are tens of thousands of hours of video and instrumental output concerned with sexual and reproductive matters. It seems to grow more extreme as the timestamps increase, from simple observation of sexual acts, then towards sexual experimentation upon subjects in increasingly elaborate machinery.\n\nThe team has forwarded some of the choicest bits to our homeworld for \"more detailed evaluation\" while whey continue to explore the underground facility."
lvb_living_laboratory.11.continue: "What in the world..."

lvb_living_laboratory.12.name: "Translated Texts"
lvb_living_laboratory.12.desc: "Our archaeological team has managed to translate a portion of the alien language, confirming their initial suspicion that the lockdown of the undeground facilitiy was an accident caused by a programming error. While most of the researchers were away, one of the janitorial staff presed the wrong button, and The security system denied all attempts to lift it.\n\nMore interesting than that, however, are the researcher's notes. They were pursuing what they termed IGP - Intelligent Gestation Pods - harnessing the biological potential of their subjects to produce pharmaceuticals and industrially useful compounds. It seems they were on the cusp of what they considered success when the project abruptly ended. The logs suggest, however, that the experimental subjects were housed in a deeper level we must have missed in our initial sweep. The team is searching for it now."

lvb_living_laboratory.13.name: "Bio-Reactors"
lvb_living_laboratory.13.desc: "Deep beneath the surface of [Root.GetName], our scientists have found the fruits, horrible as they are, of the compound's research. Rows and rows of tanks, holding thousands of aliens housed in intricate machinery keeping them fed, cleaned and drugged. The fact that they've survived nearly a thousand years in this state is testament to their captors scientific prowess, now clearly revealed as somewhat greater than our own.\n\nOur researches report that the captives shudder and moan, apparently brought to climax dozens of times per day so their secretions can be collected and analyzed - though without researches to do the analysis, there's a tank of vaginal secretions and cum deep enough to go swimming in kept in stasis."

More than a few of our populace might be willing to volunteer for a 6-month stint in such a tank..."
lvb_living_laboratory.20.desc: "Disassembling the living laboratory has revealed to us some of its secrets - namely, how to both increase the production of our own Bioreactors and make sure our citizens enjoy their stay. While decanting can be rather disorienting at first, 97% of those who spend a few months climaxing in our machinery as living fuckdolls report enjoying the experience.

lvb_living_laboratory.21.desc: "The project to extend our leader's lifespan using the technology uncovered in the living laboratory has had mixed results. On the one hand, it's extremely effective, adding decades to the lifespan of those blessed to spend time in the modified bioreactors. On the other though, the process is... addictive.
