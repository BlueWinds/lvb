lvb_tentacle_extinction_name: "Kidnapped by tentacle monsters"
lvb_tentacle_extinction_desc: "[lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName] was leading an expedition to survey the seemingly idealic world when the expedition was attacked by the local wildlife, which turns out to be exceedingly strong and very horny. The shuttle cameras recorded the away team's capture and rape before the pilot had to take off lest she too be taken. [lvb_tentacle_scientist]'s transponder indicates that [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetSheHe] is still alive, but we'll need to learn more about the wildlife before mounting a rescue attempt."

lvb.tentacle_extinction.1.name: "Safe(?) landing"
lvb.tentacle_extinction.1.desc: "The expedition finally made a breakthrough when one of the pilots running a low-altitude survey of the planet discovered that the monsters infesting every continent seemed to avoid certain species of trees. Isolating a pungent oil from the bark has allowed our scientists to land and begin learning more about this bizzare ecology. The oil only lasts a day - progress has been slowed by the fact that several explorers go missing every month when they're even a few minutes late reapplying the tentacle-repellent."

lvb.tentacle_extinction.3.name: "Under the jungle"
lvb.tentacle_extinction.3.desc: "Beneath the jungles of [From.Planet.GetName], we've found something interesting - this planet was once home to a technological civilization. The fact that they mainly built with concrete and steel suggests that they hadn't yet reached the stars when they went extinct. Preliminary analysis suggests that they looked remarkably similar to [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesNamePlural], and many speculate that this is why the tentacle monsters find us so fascinating when they ignore other native animals."

lvb.tentacle_extinction.4.name: "Tunnels"
lvb.tentacle_extinction.4.desc: "Though it's been some time since [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetName] disappeared, [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetSheHe] have not been forgotten. Tracking [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetHerHim] transponder has led the investigation below ground, to a series of tunnels seemingly covering most of the planets surface. These tunnels were fiercely defended, and even the tree oil isn't enough to repel the monsters when our teams attempt to enter them. We'll have to fight our way in if we want to find [lvb_tentacle_scientist] and other lost team members."

lvb.tentacle_extinction.5.name: "Breeding Chambers"
lvb.tentacle_extinction.5.desc: "This excavation has taken on the tone of a military campaign more than an archaeological expedition. Fighting their way in, our troops finally managed to find their way to [lvb_tentacle_scientist]'s transponder, and what they found there horrified them. [lvb_tentacle_scientist.GetSheHeCap] has been half absorbed by a living wall, "
