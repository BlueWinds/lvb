Decoding the light proved easy enough, but the result was disappointing - it appears to be little more than an alien boast over the girth of his tentacles and the number of females penetrated.

They greeted each other in the airlock with a great deal of laughter from all involved, and it rapidly devolved into a gangbang when the visitor shed her clothes and told the crew to \"Come and get it.\""
lvb_anomalies.2.a: "Where did she get a shuttle?"
