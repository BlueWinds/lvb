# Lovely Vibes in Blue
This is an adult mod for Stellaris, originally inspired by [Lustful Void](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/119724-mod-stellaris-lustful-void-wip) but since diverging greatly.

## What's in here

- Adds several dozen new sexy species traits (All-Female, Sadistic, Prehensile Tentacles, Targeted Pheromones, for some examples).
- Adds several new technologies related to sex, including two new policies (Sex Trade Policy and Milk Cow policy).
- Adds several new buildings, such as the Dairy Farm and Slave Brothel, which integrate with the vanilla economy in a balanced way.
- Adds the Sensuality and Sexuality tradition trees. Have your people work as whores, use their wombs and cum as biological factories or upgrade your Resort World to a Red Light Planet.
- Adds two new portrait packs (anime girls and cat girls) for your species, hand edited to fit in with the style of the base game.
- Two new sexy archaeology sites, with tentacle monsters and women in test tubes.
- A new enclave, the Sex Slavers, who want to buy your people and sell them back to you.
- Additional anomalies, events, planetary decisions and modifiers

Because the Traditions screen isnâ€™t dynamic, this mod is incompatible with any other mod that adds more Tradition trees, and will overwrite them. If you want to use traditions from other mods instead of this one, download the Traditionless zip file - you'll be missing out, but it at least won't break anything.

## Compiling
Because of the number of traits Lovely Vibes adds, there ended up being a *ton* of duplication in the jobs file. Thus, I pulled it out and added templating. To build your own release, you'll now need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This is free and available for all platforms. You'll also need [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) installed for the `convert` program, which this mod uses to change its png assets into dds. I've only tested compilation on Linux, but there's no reason it shouldn't work on Windows or Mac as well.
