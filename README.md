# Lustful Void Edits
This is a patch-mod for Stellaris, updating the [Lustful Void|https://www.loverslab.com/topic/119724-mod-stellaris-lustful-void-wip] mod with some personal tweaks. All credit to Lithia<3, I claim none.

## What's in here
This mod depends on Lustful Void - it won't work without it.

With that said, this mod:
- Removes the Brothel, Bordello, Sex Market and Sex City buildings
- Adds two new technologies, Sex Trade Policy and an advanced version, which unlock a policy, Sex Trade Policy.
  - Allowing or Encouraging sex work replaces some cleric jobs in Commercial Zones with sex work.
  - Mandating it also adds sex jobs based on a planet's population

In short, rather than a brand new building chains (which duplicated Commercial Zones and Holo Theaters), sex work is integrated more closely with Stellaris base game content.
